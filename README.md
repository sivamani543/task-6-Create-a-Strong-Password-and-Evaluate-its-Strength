## Passwords Tested and Evaluation

| Password              | Complexity Used                        | Strength      | Time to Crack        | Feedback                            |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| password123           | Lowercase + Numbers                    | Very Weak      | 0 seconds             | Common and predictable              |
| p@ssw0rd!             | Lowercase + Symbols                    | Very Weak      | 0 seconds             | Contains dictionary word            |
| 123456                | Numbers only                           | Very Weak      | 0 seconds             | Extremely weak and widely used      |
| MyC@t$Eat5Fi$h        | Upper, Lower, Numbers, Symbols         | Very Strong    | 4 years               | Strong passphrase with complexity   |
| !QAZ2wsx#EDC4rfv      | Complex pattern, 16 chars              | Very Strong    | 112 years             | Excellent security                  |

## Key Learnings

- Use 12 or more characters for better strength  
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters  
- Avoid dictionary words, patterns, or reused passwords  
- Passphrases like "MyC@t$Eat5Fi$h" are strong and memorable  
- Use a password manager to store and generate complex passwords

---

## Common Password Attacks

- Brute Force Attack – Tries all possible combinations  
- Dictionary Attack – Uses known wordlists and patterns  
- Credential Stuffing – Reuses leaked credentials on other sites

---

## Summary: Password Complexity vs. Security

- More complexity results in better security  
- Adding length and randomness increases resistance to attacks  
- Short and simple passwords are cracked instantly  
- Online tools help visualize password strength and improvement
